                <p>My name is Sameeha Zahid
                    I am currently a student studying Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London.
                    I plan to graduate with a first class BSc degree in 2026, and hopefully go on to do a masters in a specialised field like Data or AI.
                    I am a very ambitious and hardworking individual, and I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.<br><br>
                    I hope to find a nice graduate job once I am finished with my studies, and I hope to work for a company that has a nice work environment.
                </p>
